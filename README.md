# Assignment: AWS or Similar Software Engineering Certification Study and Presentation

## Objective 

Familiarize students with a popular cloud computing certification and the technologies and skills it covers.

## Instructions

Choose a cloud computing certification from a reputable provider such as AWS (Amazon Web Services), Azure (Microsoft), Google Cloud, or Oracle Cloud.

Research the following aspects of the chosen certification:
- Overview of the certification
- Key topics and technologies covered
- Requirements for obtaining the certification
- Job roles and career opportunities related to the certification
- Recommended study materials and resources

Dedicate time to studying for the certification and take practice exams to assess your understanding of the topics covered.

Create a study report in the format of your choice (e.g. a Google Slides presentation, a Word document, a LaTeX file)

In your presentation, explain the certification you have chosen, including the key topics and technologies it covers, requirements for obtaining the certification, and career opportunities related to it. Share your study experience, including any challenges and strategies for success, and offer recommendations for other students who may be interested in obtaining the certification in the future.

Be prepared to give a 15 minute presentation to the class, summarizing the key points of your report.


# Assignment: Machine Learning with Python and Dataset Analysis

## Objective 

Familiarize students with the process of using machine learning to analyze a dataset and to apply their Python skills.

## Instructions

Find a dataset that interests you. There are many public datasets available online, such as on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php), or the United States government's data portal (https://data.gov/).

Research the dataset you have chosen, including the following:
- Description of the data and its features
- Potential applications or use cases
- Challenges or limitations associated with the data

Clean and pre-process the data as necessary, including handling missing values, normalizing features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Choose a machine learning algorithm that is appropriate for the type of problem you wish to solve (e.g. classification, regression, clustering, etc.).

Train your chosen algorithm on the training data and evaluate its performance on the testing data.

Create a report in the format of your choice (e.g. a Google Slides presentation, a Word document, a Jupyter Notebook)

In your report, explain the dataset you have chosen, the machine learning algorithm you have used, the results of your analysis, and any insights you have gained from the data.

Be prepared to give a 15 minute presentation to the class, summarizing the key points of your report.



# Assignment: Multithreaded Server and Object Oriented Programming

## Objective

Familiarize students with building a multithreaded server and the principles of object-oriented programming.

## Instructions

Choose a programming language that you are comfortable with (e.g. Python, Java, C++, etc.).

Research the basics of multithreaded servers and the principles of object-oriented programming in your chosen language.

Design and build a multithreaded server that performs a simple task such as echoing back messages sent to the server.

Adhere to good object-oriented programming practices such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Create a report in the format of your choice (e.g. a Google Slides presentation, a Word document, a LaTeX file)

In your report, explain your design decisions, including the architecture of your server and the use of object-oriented programming principles. Provide examples of the code you have written and any challenges you encountered while building the server.

Be prepared to give a 15 minute presentation to the class, summarizing the key points of your report and demonstrating the functionality of your server.
